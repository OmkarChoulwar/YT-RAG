      "to linear regression algorithm in depth, I'll give you a quick overview\n",
      "of today's agenda. So we'll start a session with a quick overview\n",
      "of what is regression as linear regression\n",
      "is one of a type of regression algorithm. Once we learn about regression, it's use case the various\n",
      "types of it next. We'll learn about the algorithm\n",
      "from scratch where I'll teach you it's mathematical\n",
      "implementation first, then we'll drill down\n",

      "using the R square method. And then finally, what will do will optimize\n",
      "it using the Gradient descent method in the last part\n",
      "on the coding session. I'll teach you to implement\n",
      "linear regression using Python and the coding session\n",
      "would be divided into two parts. The first part would consist of linear regression\n",
      "using python from scratch where you will use\n",
      "the mathematical algorithm that you have learned\n",
      "in this session. And in the next part\n",
      "of the coding session will be using scikit-learn\n",
      "for direct implementation of linear regression. All right. I hope the agenda is clear\n",
      "to you guys are like so let's begin our session\n",
      "with what is regression. Well regression analysis is a form of predictive\n",
      "modeling technique which investigates\n",
      "the relationship between a dependent\n",
      "and independent variable a regression analysis\n",
      "involves graphing a line over a set of data points that most closely fits\n",
      "the overall shape of the data or regression shows the changes\n",
      "in a dependent variable on the y-axis to the changes in the explanatory variable\n",
      "on the x-axis fine. Now you would ask\n",
      "what are the uses of regression? Well, they are major\n",
      "three uses of regression. Let's has the first\n",
      "being determining the strength of predictors, 's the regression might be used to identify\n",
      "the strength of the effect that the independent variables\n",
      "have on the dependent variable. For example, you\n",
      "can ask question. Like what is the strength\n",
      "of relationship between sales and marketing spending or what\n",
      "is the relationship between age and income second is forecasting and effect in this\n",
      "the regression can be used to forecast effects\n",
      "or impact of changes. That is the regression analysis\n",
      "helped us to understand how much the dependent variable\n",
      "changes with the change in one or more\n",
      "independent variable fine. For example, you\n",
      "can ask question like how much additional sale income will I get for each thousand\n",
      "dollars spent on marketing. So it is Trend forecasting\n",
      "in this the regression analysis to predict Trends\n",
      "and future values. The regression analysis can\n",
      "be used to get Point estimates in this you can ask questions. Like what will be\n",
      "the price of Bitcoin in next six months, right? So next topic is linear\n",
      "versus logistic regression. By now, I hope\n",
      "that you know, what a regression is. So let's move on\n",
      "and understand its type. So there are various\n",
      "kinds of regression like linear regression logistic\n",
      "regression polynomial regression and others early, but for this session will be focusing on linear\n",
      "and logistic regression. So let's move on and let me tell\n",
      "you what is linear regression. And what is logistic regression then what we'll do\n",
      "we'll compare both of them. All right. So starting with\n",
      "linear regression in simple linear regression, we are interested in things\n",
      "like y equal MX plus C. So what we are trying to find\n",
      "is the correlation between X and Y variable this means that every value of x has\n",
      "a corresponding value of y in it if it is continuous. All right, however\n",
      "in logistic regression, we are not fitting our data\n",
      "to a straight line like linear regression instead\n",
      "what we are doing. We are mapping Y versus X to a sigmoid function\n",
      "in logistic regression. What we find out is is y 1 or 0\n",
      "for this particular value of x That's we are essentially\n",
      "deciding true or false value for a given value of x fine. So as a core concept\n",
      "of linear regression, you can see that the data is\n",
      "model using a straight line. We're in the case\n",
      "of logistic regression. The data is model using\n",
      "a sigmoid function. The linear regression is used\n",
      "with continuous variables on the other hand\n",
      "the logistic regression. It is used with categorical\n",
      "variable the output or the prediction\n",
      "of a linear regression is the value of the variable on the other hand the output of prediction of a logistic\n",
      "regression is the probability of occurrence of the event. Now, how will you\n",
      "check the accuracy and goodness of fit in case of linear regression\n",
      "are various methods like measured by loss r squared\n",
      "adjusted r squared Etc while in the case\n",
      "of logistic regression you have accuracy precision\n",
      "recall F1 score, which is nothing but\n",
      "the harmonic mean of precision and recall next is Roc curve for determining the probability\n",
      "threshold for classification or the confusion Matrix Etc. There are many. All right, so\n",
      "Rising the difference between linear and logistic\n",
      "regression you can say that the type of function you are mapping to is\n",
      "the main point of difference between linear and logistic\n",
      "regression a linear regression Maps a continuous X2 a continuous fi\n",
      "on the other hand a logistic regression\n",
      "Maps a continuous x to the binary why so we can use logistic\n",
      "regression to make category or true false decisions from the data find so let's move on ahead next is linear\n",
      "regression selection criteria, or you can say when will\n",
      "you use linear regression? So the first is classification and regression capabilities\n",
      "regression models predict a continuous variable such as\n",
      "the sales made on a day or predict the temperature of a city their Reliance\n",
      "on a polynomial like a straight line\n",
      "to fit a data set poses a real challenge when it comes towards building\n",
      "a classification capability. Let's imagine that you fit\n",
      "a line with the train points that you have to imagine you add\n",
      "some more data points to it. But in order to fit it\n",
      "what you have to do, you have to change\n",
      "your existing model. That is Maybe. Between the threshold itself. So this will happen\n",
      "with each new data point you are to the model hence. The linear regression is not\n",
      "good for classification models. Fine. Next is data quality\n",
      "each missing value removes one data point that\n",
      "could optimize the regression in simple linear regression. The outliers can significantly disrupt the outcome\n",
      "just for now, you can know that if you\n",
      "remove the outliers your model will become very good. All right. So this is about data quality\n",
      "next is computational complexity a linear regression is often\n",
      "not computationally expensive as compared to the decision tree or the clustering algorithm\n",
      "the order of complexity for n training example and X features usually Falls\n",
      "in either Big O of x square or bigger of xn\n",
      "next is comprehensible and transparent the\n",
      "linear regression are easily comprehensible\n",
      "and transparent in nature. They can be represented by\n",
      "a simple mathematical notation to anyone and can be\n",
      "understood very easily. So these are some\n",
      "of the criteria based on which you will select\n",
      "the linear regression algorithm. Alright next is where is linear regression\n",
      "used first is evaluating Trends and sales estimate. Well linear regression\n",
      "can be used in business to evaluate Trends\n",
      "and make estimates or focused. For example, if a company sales have\n",
      "increased steadily every month for past few years, then conducting a linear\n",
      "analysis on the sales data with monthly sales on the y axis\n",
      "and time on the x axis. This will give you a line that predicts the upward Trends\n",
      "in the sale after creating the trendline the company\n",
      "could use the slope of the lines to focus\n",
      "sale in future months. Next is analyzing. The impact of price changes\n",
      "will linear regression can be used to analyze\n",
      "the effect of pricing on consumer behavior. For instance. If a company changes the price on a certain\n",
      "product several times, then it can record the quantity\n",
      "itself or each price level and then perform\n",
      "a linear regression with sold quantity as a dependent variable and price\n",
      "as the independent variable. This would result in a line\n",
      "that depicts the extent to which the Reduce\n",
      "their consumption of the product as the price is increasing. So this result would help us\n",
      "in future pricing decisions. Next is assessment of risk\n",
      "in financial services and insurance domain for linear regression\n",
      "can be used to analyze the risk, for example health insurance\n",
      "company might conduct a linear regression algorithm how it can do it can do it\n",
      "by plotting the number of claims per customer against its age\n",
      "and they might discover that the old customers then to make more\n",
      "health insurance claim. Well the result of such analysis might guide\n",
      "important business decisions. All right, so by now you\n",
      "have just a rough idea of what linear regression\n",
      "algorithm as like what it does where it is used when you should use\n",
      "it early now, let's move on and understand\n",
      "the algorithm and depth So suppose you have independent\n",
      "variable on the x-axis and dependent variable\n",
      "on the y-axis. All right suppose this is\n",
      "the data point on the x axis. The independent variable\n",
      "is increasing on the x axis. And so does the dependent\n",
      "variable on the y-axis? So what kind of linear\n",
      "regression line you would get you would get a positive\n",
      "linear regression line. All right as the slope would\n",
      "be positive next is suppose. You have an independent\n",
      "variable on the x-axis which is increasing and on the other hand the\n",
      "dependent variable on the y-axis that is decreasing. So what kind of line\n",
      "will you get in that case? You will get\n",
      "a negative regression line. In this case as the slope\n",
      "of the line is negative and this particular line that is line of y equal MX plus C is a line\n",
      "of linear regression which shows the relationship\n",
      "between independent variable and dependent variable and this line is only known\n",
      "as line of linear regression. Okay. So let's add some data\n",
      "points to our graph. So these are some observation\n",
      "or data points on our graphs. Let's plot some more. Okay. Now all our data points\n",
      "are plotted now our task is to create a regression line\n",
      "or the best fit line. All right. Now once our regression\n",
      "line is drawn now, it's the task\n",
      "of production now suppose. This is our estimated value\n",
      "or the predicted value and this is our actual value. Okay. So what we have to do our main\n",
      "goal is to reduce this error that is to reduce the distance\n",
      "between the estimated or the predicted value\n",
      "and the actual value. The best fit line would be the\n",
      "one which had the least error or the least difference\n",
      "in estimated value and the actual value. All right, and other words we\n",
      "have to minimize the error. This was a brief understanding of linear regression\n",
      "algorithm soon. We'll jump towards\n",
      "mathematical implementation. All right, but for then\n",
      "let me tell you this. Suppose you draw a graph\n",
      "with speed on the x-axis and distance covered on the y axis with the time\n",
      "demeaning constant. If you plot a graph\n",
      "between the speed travel by the vehicle and the distance traveled\n",
      "in a fixed unit of time, then you will get\n",
      "a positive relationship. All right. So suppose the equation\n",
      "of line as y equal MX plus C. Then in this case Y is\n",
      "the distance traveled in a fixed duration of time x is the speed of vehicle m\n",
      "is a positive slope of the line and see is\n",
      "the y-intercept of the line. All right suppose\n",
      "the distance remaining constant. You have to plot a graph\n",
      "between the speed of the vehicle and the time taken\n",
      "to travel a fixed distance. Then in that case\n",
      "you will get a line with a negative relationship. All right, the slope\n",
      "of the line is negative here the equation of line changes\n",
      "to y equal minus of MX plus C where Y is the time taken\n",
      "to travel a fixed distance X is the speed of vehicle m is\n",
      "the negative slope of the line and see is\n",
      "the y-intercept of the line. All right now, let's get back\n",
      "to our Independent variable. So in that term why is\n",
      "our dependent variable and X that is\n",
      "our independent variable. Now, let's move on and see the mathematical implementation\n",
      "of the things. Alright, so we have x equal 1 2 3 4 5 let's plot\n",
      "them on the x-axis. So 0123456 alike\n",
      "and we have y as 34245. All right. So let's plot 1 2 3 4 5 on the y-axis. Now, let's plot our coordinates 1 by 1 so x\n",
      "equal 1 and y equal 3, so we have here x equal 1 and y equal 3, so there's a point\n",
      "1 comma 3 so similarly we have 13243244 and 55. Alright, so moving on ahead. Let's calculate the mean of X\n",
      "and Y and plot it on the graph. All right, so mean of X is 1 plus 2 plus 3 plus 4\n",
      "plus 5 divided by 5. That is 3. All right. Similarly mean of Y\n",
      "is 3 plus 4 plus. 2 plus 4 plus 5 that is 18. So 18 divided by 5. That is nothing but 3.6 aligned. So next what we'll do\n",
      "we'll plot R Min that is 3 comma 3 .6\n",
      "on the graph. Okay. So there's a point 3 comma 3 .6 see our goal is to find\n",
      "or predict the best fit line using the least Square\n",
      "Method All right. So in order to find that we first need to find\n",
      "the equation of line, so let's find the equation\n",
      "of our regression line. All right. So let's suppose this is our regression line\n",
      "y equal MX plus C. Now, we have\n",
      "an equation of line. So all we need to do is\n",
      "find the value of M and see where m equals summation of x minus X bar X Y minus y bar\n",
      "upon the summation of x minus X bar whole Square\n",
      "don't get confused. Let me resolve it for you. Alright, so moving on\n",
      "ahead as a part of formula. What we are going to do\n",
      "will calculate x minus X bar. So we have X as 1 minus X bar\n",
      "as 3 so 1 minus 3 It is minus 2 next we have x\n",
      "equal to minus its mean 3 that is minus 1 similarly. We have 3 minus 3 is 0 4 -\n",
      "3 1 5 - 3 2. All right, so x minus X bar. It's nothing but the distance\n",
      "of all the point through the line y equal 3 and what does this y minus y bar implies\n",
      "it implies the distance of all the point from the line x equal 3 .6 fine. So let's calculate the value\n",
      "of y minus y bar. So starting with y equal 3 - value of y bar\n",
      "that is 3.6. So it is three minus 3.6\n",
      "how much - of 0.6 next is 4 minus 3.6\n",
      "that is 0.4 next to minus 3.6 that is - of 1.6. Next is 4 minus 3.6\n",
      "that is 0.4 again, 5 minus 3.6 that is\n",
      "one point four. Alright, so now we are done\n",
      "with Y minus y bar. Fine now next we will calculate\n",
      "x minus X bar whole Square. So let's calculate x\n",
      "minus X bar whole Square so it is minus 2 whole square. That is 4 minus 1 whole square. That is 1 0 squared is\n",
      "0 1 Square 1 2 square for fine. So now in our table we have x\n",
      "minus X bar y minus y bar and x minus X bar whole Square. Now what we need. We need the product of x\n",
      "minus X bar X Y minus y bar. Alright, so let's see\n",
      "the product of x minus X bar X Y minus y bar that is minus\n",
      "of 2 x minus of 0.6 that is 1.2 minus\n",
      "of 1 multiplied by zero point 4 that is\n",
      "minus of 0 point 4 0 x minus of 1.6. That is 0 1 multiplied\n",
      "by zero point four that is 0.4. And next 2 multiplied\n",
      "by 1 point for that is 2.8. All right. Now almost all the parts\n",
      "of our formula is done. So now what we need\n",
      "to do is get the summation of last two columns. All right, so the summation of X minus X bar\n",
      "whole square is 10 and the summation of x minus X bar X Y minus y bar is 4\n",
      "so the value of M will be equal to 4 by 10 fine. So let's put this value\n",
      "of m equals zero point four and our line y equal MX plus C. So let's fill all the points\n",
      "into the equation and find the value of C. So we have y as 3.6 remember\n",
      "the mean by Ms. 0.4 which we calculated just now X\n",
      "as the mean value of x that is 3 and we have the equation as 3 point\n",
      "6 equals 0 point 4 x 3 plus C. Alright that is 3.6 equal\n",
      "1 Point 2 plus C. So what is the value of C\n",
      "that is 3.6 minus 1 Point 2. That is 2 point 4. All right. So what we had we had m\n",
      "equals zero point four see as 2.4 and then finally when we calculate the equation\n",
      "of the regression line what we get is y equal\n",
      "zero point four times of X plus two point four. So this is the regression line. All right, so there is how you\n",
      "are plotting your points. This is your actual point. All right. Now for given m equals\n",
      "zero point four and SQL 2.4. Let's predict the value of y\n",
      "for x equal 1 2 3 4 & 5. So when x equal\n",
      "1 the predicted value of y will be zero point 4 x one\n",
      "plus two point four that is 2.8. Similarly when x equal\n",
      "to predicted value of y will be zero point 4 x 2 + 2 point 4 that equals\n",
      "to 3 point 2 similarly x equal 3 y will be 3 point 6 x equal 4 y will be 4 point 0 x equal 5 y will be\n",
      "four point four. So let's plot them on the graph and the line passing through\n",
      "all these predicting point and cutting y-axis\n",
      "at 2.4 as the line of regression now your task\n",
      "is to calculate the distance between the actual and the predicted value and your job is\n",
      "to reduce the distance. Like or in other words, you have to reduce the error\n",
      "between the actual and the predicted value the line with the least error will be\n",
      "the line of linear regression or regression line and it will also be\n",
      "the best fit line. Alright, so this is\n",

      "n number of iteration for different values of M\n",

      "a statistical measure of how close the data are to the fitted regression\n",
      "line in general. It is considered that a high r-squared\n",

      "for a good model as well or a higher squared\n",
      "value for a model that does not fit at all. All right. It is also known as\n",
      "coefficient of determination or the coefficient\n",
      "of multiple determination. Let's move on and see\n",
      "how a square is calculated. So these are our actual values\n",
      "plotted on the graph. We had calculated\n",
      "the predicted values of Y as 2.8 3.2 3.6 4.0 4.4. Remember when we calculated\n",
      "the predicted values of Y for the equation Y\n",
      "predicted equals 014 X of X plus two point four for every x\n",
      "equal 1 2 3 4 & 5 from there. We got the predicted\n",
      "values of Y. All right. So let's plot it on the graph. So these are point\n",
      "and the line passing through these points are nothing\n",
      "but the regression line. All right. Now what you need to do is you have to check and compare\n",
      "the distance of actual - mean versus the distance\n",
      "of predicted - mean. Alright. So basically what you are doing\n",
      "you are calculating the distance of actual value to the mean\n",
      "to distance of predicted value to the mean I like so there is nothing\n",
      "but a square in mathematically you can represent\n",
      "our Square as summation of Y predicted values\n",
      "minus y bar whole Square divided by summation of Y minus\n",
      "y bar whole Square where Y is the actual value y p is the predicted value\n",
      "and Y Bar is the mean value of y that is nothing but 3.6. So remember, this\n",
      "is our formula. So next what we'll do\n",
      "we'll calculate y minus y bar. So we have y is 3y bar as\n",
      "3 point 6 so we'll calculate it as 3 minus 3.6 that is nothing but\n",
      "minus of 0.6 similarly for y equal 4\n",
      "and Y Bar equal 3.6. We have y minus y bar as\n",
      "zero point 4 then 2 minus 3.6. It is 1 point 6 4 minus\n",
      "3.6 again zero point four and five minus 3.6 it is 1.4. So we got the value\n",
      "of y minus y bar. Now what we have to do we\n",
      "have to take it Square. So we have minus of 0.6 Square\n",
      "as 0.36 0.4 Square as 0.16 - of 1.6 Square as 2.56 0.4 Square\n",
      "as 0.16 and 1.4 squared is 1.96 now is a part\n",
      "of formula what we need. We need our YP\n",
      "minus y BAR value. So these are VIP values and we have to subtract\n",
      "it from the mean. No, right. So 2 .8 minus 3.6\n",
      "that is minus 0.8. Similarly. We will get 3.2 minus 3.6 that is 0.4 and 3.6 minus 3.6\n",
      "that is 0410 minus 3.6 that is 0.4. Then 4 .4 minus 3.6 that is 0.8. So we calculated the value\n",
      "of YP minus y bar now, it's our turn to calculate\n",
      "the value of y b minus y bar whole Square next. We have -\n",
      "of 0.8 Square as 0.64 - of 0.4 Square as 0.160 Square\n",
      "zero zero point four square as again 0.16 and\n",
      "0.8 Square as 0164. All right. Now as a part of formula what it suggests it suggests\n",
      "me to take the summation of Y P minus y bar whole square and summation of Y minus\n",
      "y bar whole Square. All right. Let's see. So in submitting y minus y bar whole Square\n",
      "what you get is five point two and summation of Y P minus y bar whole Square you\n",
      "get one point six. So the value of R square\n",
      "can be calculated as 1 point 6 upon 5.2 fine. So the result which will get\n",
      "is approximately equal to 0.3. Well, this is not a good fit. All right, so it suggests that the data points are far\n",
      "away from the regression line. Alright, so this is how your graph will look\n",
      "like when R square is 0.3 when you increase the value\n",
      "of R square to 0.7. So you'll see that the actual value would like\n",
      "closer to the regression line when it reaches\n",
      "to 0.9 Atkins more clothes and when the value\n",
      "of approximately equals to 1 then the actual values lies\n",
      "on the regression line itself, for example, in this case if you get a very low value\n",
      "of R square suppose 0.02. So in that case what will see\n",
      "that the actual values are very far away from the regression\n",
      "line or you can say that there are too\n",
      "many outliers in your data. You cannot focus\n",
      "anything from the data. All right. So this was all about\n",
      "the calculation of R square now, you might get a question\n",
      "like are low values of Square always bad. Well in some field it\n",
      "is entirely expected that I ask where\n",
      "value will be low. For example any field that attempts to predict human\n",
      "behavior such as psychology typically has r-squared values\n",
      "lower than around 50% through which you can conclude that humans are simply harder to predict on the physical\n",
      "process furthermore. If you ask what value is low, but you have statistically\n",
      "significant predictors, then you can still\n",
      "draw important conclusion about how changes in the predicator values\n",
      "associated with the changes in the response value regardless of the r-squared the significant coefficient\n",
      "still represent the mean change in the response for one unit\n",
      "of change in the predicator while holding other predicate is\n",
      "in the model constant, obviously this type of information can be\n",
      "extremely valuable. All right. All right. So this was all about\n",
      "the theoretical concept now, let's move on to the coding part and understand the\n",
      "code in depth. So for implementing\n",
      "linear regression using python, I'll be using Anaconda with jupyter notebook\n",
      "installed on it. So I like there's\n",
      "a jupyter notebook and we are using python 3.01 it alright, so we are going\n",
      "to use a data set consisting of head size and human brain\n",
      "of different people. All right. So let's import our data set\n",
      "percent matplotlib and line. We are importing numpy as NP pandas as speedy\n",
      "and matplotlib and from a totally we are importing\n",
      "pipe lot of that as PLT. Alright next we will import\n",
      "our data head brain dot CSV and store it\n",
      "in the database table. Let's execute the Run button\n",
      "and see the output. So this task symbol, it symbolizes that\n",

      "our dataset consists of two thirty seven rows\n",
      "and 4 columns. We have columns as\n",
      "gender age range head size in centimeter Cube and brain weights\n",
      "and Graham fine. So there's our sample data set. This is how it looks it consists\n",
      "of all these data set. So now that we\n",
      "have imported our data, so as you can see they are\n",
      "237 values in the training set so we can find a linear. And Chip between the head size\n",
      "and the Brain weights. So now what we'll do\n",
      "we'll collect X & Y the X would consist\n",
      "of the head size values and the Y would consist\n",
      "of brain with values. So collecting X and Y.\n",
      "Let's execute the Run. done next what we'll do\n",
      "we need to find the values of b 1 or B naught\n",
      "or you can say m and C. So we'll need the mean of X\n",
      "and Y values first of all what we will do will calculate\n",

      "the total number of values. So m equal length of X. Alright, then we'll use the formula\n",
      "to calculate the values of b 1 + B naught or MNC. All right, let's execute the Run button and see\n",
      "what is the result. So as you can see here on the screen we have got\n",
      "d 1 as 0 point 2 6 3 and be not as three twenty\n",
      "five point five seven. Alright, so now\n",
      "that we have a coefficient. So comparing it with\n",
      "the equation y equal MX plus C. You can say that brain weight\n",
      "equals zero point 2 6 3 x head size plus 3 Seven so you can see that the value of M\n",

And then finally, what will do will optimize\\nit using the Gradient descent method in the last part\\non the coding session. I'll teach you to implement\\nlinear regression using Python and the coding session\\nwould be divided into two parts. The first part would consist of linear regression\\nusing python from scratch where you will use\\nthe mathematical algorithm that you have learned\\nin this session.

The outliers can significantly disrupt the outcome\\njust for now, you can know that if you\\nremove the outliers your model will become very good. All right. So this is about data quality\\nnext is computational complexity a linear regression is often\\nnot computationally expensive as compared to the decision tree or the clustering algorithm\\nthe order of complexity for n training example and X features usually Falls\\nin either Big O of x square or bigger of xn\\nnext is comprehensible and transparent the\\nlinear regression are easily comprehensible\\nand transparent in nature.

Well linear regression\\ncan be used in business to evaluate Trends\\nand make estimates or focused.

This will give you a line that predicts the upward Trends')]"

Let's move on and see\\nhow will you implement the model using machine learning\\nlibrary call scikit-learn. All right. So this scikit-learn is a simple\\nmachine learning library in Python welding machine\\nlearning model are very easy using scikit-learn. So suppose there's\\na python code. So using the scikit-learn\\nlibraries your code shortens to this length like so let's execute\\nthe Run button and see you will get the same are\\nto score as Well, this was all for today's\\ndiscussion in case you have any doubt.

That is the regression analysis\\nhelped us to understand how much the dependent variable\\nchanges with the change in one or more\\nindependent variable fine. For example, you\\ncan ask question like how much additional sale income will I get for each thousand\\ndollars spent on marketing. So it is Trend forecasting\\nin this the regression analysis to predict Trends\\nand future values. The regression analysis can\\nbe used to get Point estimates in this you can ask questions. Like what will be\\nthe price of Bitcoin in next six months, right? So next topic is linear\\nversus logistic regression. By now, I hope\\nthat you know, what a regression is. So let's move on\\nand understand its type. So there are various\\nkinds of regression like linear regression logistic\\nregression polynomial regression and others early, but for this session will be focusing on linear\\nand logistic regression. So let's move on and let me tell\\nyou what is linear regression. And what is logistic regression then what we'll do\\nwe'll compare both of them. All right. So starting with\\nlinear regression in simple linear regression, we are interested in things\\nlike y equal MX plus C. So what we are trying to find\\nis the correlation between X and Y variable this means that every value of x has\\na corresponding value of y in it if it is continuous. All right, however\\nin logistic regression, we are not fitting our data\\nto a straight line like linear regression instead\""
